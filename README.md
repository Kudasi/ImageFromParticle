# ImageFromParticle
Project created just for fun, using processing.

It is a **cfg** file for options like:
>***imagePath*** - path to image file
>
>***outputFolder*** - folder for saving window screenshot (press **SPACE** to take a photo)
>
>***resolutionDivisor*** - how much resolution of input image should be divided (greater value give more performance)
>
>***radiusMultiplier*** - increaces a size of particles
>
>***blend*** - how much blending do particles have (just a alpha divisor)
